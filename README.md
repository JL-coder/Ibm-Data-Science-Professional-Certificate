# Ibm-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate
Repository for learning exercises performed in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate courses
Note: A few of the data analysis and data visualization files show "keyboard errors" followed by a graph. 
This is due to a problem with the servers that occured for several weeks while taking these courses and will be fixed eventually along
with any files that may not be displayed properly in github. That being said the graphs themselves are accurate and if 
download the files they should be displayed properly.
